# Wallpaper++
Wallpaper++ (previously known as Dynamic Desktop and Codename: Dreamscene) lets you set your wallpaper to a video or html file, kinda like Windows Dreamscene and Active Desktop combined.
## Supported Files
✔ Pictures (For some reason)  
✔ Videos  
✔* HTML (Implementation is barebones. Really only meant for basic html and css.)  
✔ Gifs
